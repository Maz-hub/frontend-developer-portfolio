# 🌐 Frontend Developer Portfolio (React + Tailwind 4 + Vite)

This is my personal **Frontend Developer Portfolio**, built with **React**, **React Router 7**, **Tailwind CSS v4**, and **Vite**.  
It showcases my real projects, experiments, and growth as I transition into frontend development.

---

## ✨ Overview

The portfolio is designed to reflect who I am as a developer — **curious, detail-oriented, and grounded** — with a clean, minimal UI built around calm dark blue tones, green and soft yellow accents, and simple, clear typography.

Everything you see here is part of my learning and creation process, built project by project.
